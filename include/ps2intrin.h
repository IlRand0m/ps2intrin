/*
*	<*intrin.h>-like wrapper functions for pipeline 1, multiply-add and multimedia instructions.
*	Functions taking an immediate value as argument have macro versions exposing this
*	functionality. C++ convenience wrappers are provided as well.
*
*	These functions are declared 'always_inline'. You should not take their addresses or call
*	them using function pointers.
* 
*	The '__m128i' analogue are split up by integer type. There are plenty of no-op conversion
*	functions. This is done to make integer type mismatches easier to notice.
*	
*	A note for developers looking to use these functions:
*	The EE Core Multimedia Instructions have most support for these types: 'int16_t', 'int32_t'
*	and 'uint32_t'. If you plan on using these functions you should make sure your data is in
*	this format. The variants operating on 64-bit values are mostly just 32-bit values plus 32
*	bits of sign extension, not real 64-bit integers.
